# react-fast

collections of react labs.

NOTE: when creating react app, Make sure you are in react-fast main directory.

Step 1: Create the React App  

1.  Open the Project Folder  
2.  Opening a new terminal   
3.  Run the following command to create the React app named <your_app_name>:  $ npx create-react-app react-lab_random-cards
4.  $ cd react-lab_random-cards
5.  $ npm start
6.  


So, ultimately, npm is all about code sharing and reuse. You can use other people's code in your own projects, and you can also publish your own Node.js modules so that other people can use them.

An example npm module that can be useful for a new React developer is 
create-react-app
. While this npm module comes with its own website, you can also find some info on the 
create-react-app project on GitHub
. 

Whenever you run the npm command to add other people's code, that code, and all other Node modules that depend on it, get downloaded to your machine.

However, although it's possible to do so, this is not really necessary, at least in the case of the create-react-app Node module.

In other words, you can avoid installing the create-react-app package but still use it.

You can do that by running the following command: npm init react-app example, where “example” is the actual name of your app. You can use any name you’d like, but it’s always good to have a name that is descriptive and short.

In the next section, you'll learn how to build a brand new app that you can name: firstapp.
